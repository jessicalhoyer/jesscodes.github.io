	<h3>Summary</h3>
	<p>The Buttweiler Environmental Portal was my final capstone project to graduate college with an Associate's degree in web design and development. In order to complete this project, I was assigned to a group with five other students. We all collaborated and combined our various skills and talents to complete this project within an Agile environment. We met once a week with our group, once a week with our client, and scheduled other meetings as required.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>My part of the project was implementing the PHP scripting code to connect to our MySQL database through a React environment. I also designed some of the database tables and managed the database using the MySQL Workbench and SQL code. In addition, I also coded a separate database admin portal in order to manage the database without the use of the MySQL Workbench or SQL code.</p>
